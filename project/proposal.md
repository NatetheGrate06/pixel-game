## Description
My game is a 2D pixel-art roguelike where players explore procedurally generated dungeons, fight enemies, and collect loot in a retro-inspired visual style. It relates to media and digital arts through its focus on pixel-based visual design, interactive storytelling, and the creative integration of art and programming to build immersive gameplay experiences.

## Features
- **Procedurally Generated Levels:**  
  Each dungeon layout will be created using random generation algorithms so that every playthrough offers a unique map, room arrangement, and enemy placement.

- **Melee and Gun Combat System:**  
  The player can switch between close-range melee attacks and ranged gunfire, each with different damage types and strategies to create dynamic combat.

- **Upgrade System:**  
  Players can collect or purchase upgrades that enhance stats, abilities, or weapons, allowing progression and replayability throughout multiple dungeon runs.

## Challenges
- Learning how to effectively use **Pygame** for handling rendering, input, and collision detection.  
- Researching **procedural generation algorithms** to create random yet playable dungeon layouts.  
- Balancing **game mechanics** such as combat, upgrades, and difficulty progression to keep gameplay engaging.

## Outcomes

**Ideal Outcome:**  
A fully functional 2D pixel-art roguelike with smooth movement, responsive combat, and procedurally generated dungeons that feel unique each playthrough. The game includes multiple weapon types, upgrade options, and polished visuals and audio that showcase creativity in both programming and digital art design.

**Minimal Viable Outcome:**  
A working prototype where the player can move around a procedurally generated dungeon, engage in basic combat using melee and ranged attacks, and collect simple upgrades. The game runs smoothly in Pygame with basic pixel art visuals and a functional gameplay loop.
